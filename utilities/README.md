# Honey for CodeIgniter
Utility Scripts for the CodeIgniter PHP Framework

## About
I have fallen head-over-heels in love with CodeIgniter.
It's a powerful PHP framework that allows me to write clean, efficient code
without taking up a lot of space. If I do have a problem with it, it would be
is how involved it's setup and extension is. To fix this, I've written a
whole host of scripts that can perform a bunch of repetitive tasks so you don't
have to.

I'm a gameplay programmer by trade, and I hope that one day this library can make
web development in CodeIgniter with a text editor as friendly as using a modern
game engine like Unity or Unreal.

## Features
- A fully-interactive installer that downloads, secures, unpacks and configures 
  any release of CodeIgniter*
- Factories that can extend the functionality of your application based on
  user-modifiable templates

and more!

\* NOTE: This hasn't been tested with CodeIgniter versions below `3.1.*`

## Requirements
- An internet connection
- Python v3.6.1

## Usage
### Windows
1. Download the latest release version of **Honey for CodeIgniter**
2. Extract the `utilities` folder to the (hopefully empty) root directory of
   your project
3. Run `install.bat` following the instructions to get CodeIgniter configured
4. Enjoy!

### Other Platforms
Try running the scripts directly from the terminal.

Please note that **Honey for CodeIgniter** is intended to exist once for each
project that requires it.
